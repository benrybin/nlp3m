 Clinical data/Measure: Deep venous/Anatomy-Adj thrombosis and hypercoagulable state  
 for placement of IVC filter 
 
 Procedure: 
 Following informed consent, the patient was placed supine on the  
 fluroscopic table. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring was  
 performed. The patient received intravenous sedation/TreatmentOrProcedure. Limited  
 ultrasound of the right/Locative neck/Anatomy demonstrates patency and 
 compressibility of the right/Locative internal jugular vein/Anatomy without  
 evidence of intraluminal thrombus. The right/Locative groin was prepped  
 and draped in sterile fashion. Skin anesthesia was achieved using  
 2% Lidocaine/PharmacyOrDrug solution. The right/Locative internal jugular vein/Anatomy was  
 punctured using a 21 gauge single wall/Anatomy-Desc needle/Device. A 0.018 inch guide  
 wire was advanced into the vein/Anatomy and the needle/Device was exchanged for a  
 5 French sheath. Via the sheath, a 0.035 inch Bentson guidewire  
 was advanced into the vein/Anatomy and the needle/Device was exchanged for a 5  
 French vascular/Anatomy-Adj sheath. Via the sheath, a 5 French flush catheter/Device  
 was placed at the iliac bifurcation/Locative|Anatomy-Desc. Digital/Anatomy-Adj subtraction  
 venography/Test was performed from this station. 
 
 Findings: Inferior vena/Anatomy-Desc cavogram demonstrates standard anatomy.  
 No intraluminal filling defects/DiagnosisOrProblem are identified to suggest  
 thrombus. 
 Intervention: A stainless-steel greenfield vena/Anatomy-Desc caval/Anatomy-Adj|Anatomy-Desc filter was  
 successfully deployed below/Locative the level/Measure of the renal/Anatomy-Desc veins/Anatomy without 
 incident within the inferior vena/Anatomy-Desc cava/Anatomy|Anatomy-Desc. The patient tolerated  
 the procedure without complication. 
 
 Impression: 
 
 1) Normal inferior vena/Anatomy-Desc cavogram as above. 
 
 2) Successful deployment of IVC filter in the infrarenal IVC as  
 above,

 Clinical data/Measure: Subcutaneous abscess from gastrostomy/TreatmentOrProcedure|Device 
 tube site for drainage 
 
 Procedure: The patient was placed supine on the fluroscopic table.  
 Continuous monitoring was performed. The left/Locative upper quadrant was  
 prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Skin anesthesia was  
 achieved using 2% Lidocaine/PharmacyOrDrug solution. Limited ultrasound was  
 performed to localize the left/Locative upper quadrant subcutaneous fluid  
 collection/DIAGNOSISORPROBLEM. The left/Locative subcutaneous fluid collection/DIAGNOSISORPROBLEM was punctured  
 under ultrasound guidance using a 21 gauge needle/Device. Pus was  
 aspirated with a specimen sent for culture. A 0.018 inch  
 guidewire was advanced into the collection/DIAGNOSISORPROBLEM and the needle/Device was  
 exchanged for a 5 french sheath. Via the sheath a 0.035 inch  
 guidewire was advanced into the collection/DIAGNOSISORPROBLEM and the sheath was  
 exchanged for an 8 french catheter/Device. Via the catheter/Device  
 approximately 60cc of pus were aspirated. The catheter/Device was  
 sutured to the skin and placed to gravity drainage. 
 
 Impression: Ultrasound drainage abdomen as above.

 Clinical data/Measure: Osteomyelitis for IV antibiotics 
 Procedure: 
 Ultrasound demonstrates patency and compressibility of the right/Locative  
 brachial vein/Anatomy. The right/Locative upper extremity was prepped and draped  
 in sterile fashion. Skin anesthesia was achieved using 2 %  
 Lidocaine/PharmacyOrDrug solution. The right/Locative brachial vein/Anatomy was punctured under  
 ultrasound guidance using a 21 gauge needle/Device. A 0.018 inch  
 guidewire was advanced into the SVC and the needle/Device was exchanged  
 for a 5 French peel-away sheath. Via this sheath a 5 French  
 single lumen PICC/DEVICE|DIAGNOSISORPROBLEM line/Device was placed with its tip/Locative to the SVC/RA  
 junction. The catheter/Device flushed well and was sutured to the skin.  
 Dilute heparinized saline/Biochemistry|PharmacyOrDrug was instilled into the catheter/Device. The  
 patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. 
 
 Findings: 
 
 Ultrasound demonstrates patency and compressibility of the right/Locative  
 brachial vein/Anatomy. Spot fluoroscopic images demonstrate PICC/DEVICE|DIAGNOSISORPROBLEM line/Device  
 with tip/Locative at SVC/RA junction. 
 
 Impression: 
 
 Successful placement of a 4 French single lumen PICC/DEVICE|DIAGNOSISORPROBLEM line/Device using  
 ultrasonic and fluoroscopic guidance.
