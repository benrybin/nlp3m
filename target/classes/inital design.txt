Final Design:
app takes in 3 arguments file to be tagged,lexicon, and name of processed file


Lexicon reader design:
split txt file into string put results into map using term as key and tag as value
check to make sure string array that is split have even length if not throw error 
--when creating lexicon find smallest and largest length of terms

Tagging design:
split document into string array by space and punctuation
check each word first to see if it's longer or shorter then any words in the lexicon
if not run map against word to see if the key exists
if key exist add tag
after loop recreate text file and output using argument to name file
